This is an 'all exits' TAS of Janked Up Mario Party (JUMP). While this hack normally has a requirement that we collect 69 dragon coins to unlock all exits, we can forgo this with a clever strategy dreamed up by Bruno Visnadi. I won't spoil this yet, though. ;-)

This TAS uses all available glitches, with the exception of chuck-eat glitch. It also purposefully avoids any ACE. I put a fair amount of time into optimization, but this is absolutely not perfect. Instead, I wanted to focus on 'macro' strategies and entertainment, showing off as much of this fantastic game as I could.

## World 1

We need to retrieve all dragon coins in 5 levels to purchase a custom item which allows us to travel on the overworld 2x faster. I estimate this saves around 2 minutes throughout the run. I get dragon coins only in levels where we don't have to go too far out of our way to do so. Unfortunately, this requires some extra overworld movement. 

### Introduction to Ledges and Edges

This is mostly the same as Bruno Visnadi's any%, and in fact his time is matched down to the frame.

### Mushroom Ledge A

Here we collect dragon coins as they are mostly in our route, anyway. To turn around quickly at the midpoint, I bump into the wall to reset speed to zero. Same after grabbing the dragon coin.

### Monty Pit

No comment, although regretably Mario is off-screen for some small part of the level. This is due to 49 hop.

### Musical Grasslands

We go out of our way to get a cape. This looks slow, but saves time 
in future exits. At the end, we clip through the floor to avoid 
wasting time waiting for a Chuck to break the blocks.

### Mushroom Ledge B

No comment

### Chuckleton Plains B

Two fire flowers are forced, but we can release our reserve cape, keeping it. P-Speed is mtaintained in the underground section to keep takeoff meter for the next two areas. Corner clip to the keyhole looks quite nice!
		
### Salty Roasted Peanuts

Trivial break in the beginning. Normally we need to pass special world to beat this level, but a corner clip allows early access. The underground section is quite empty, so I have Mario play with the shell a bit. I hope it looks OK. There are a lot of chucks at the goal, but we can capespin while passing the goal point, which causes them to die. I think it looks great but actually saves over 30 frames of fadeout lag!
		
### Chuckleton Plains A

Now we just collect the rest of the dragon coins. Unfortunately I have to fly through most of this level due to tricky dragon coin placement.

### The Untitled Sky Level Place

Some tough optimization challenges here, and I get to show off some advanced flight techniques.

### Spingity Sproing

We 6/5 at the start because we need to scroll the camera up after grabbing the second dragon coin, as there are dragon coins at very high Y position. 

Gray platform glitch may save some time here. I couldn't get it to work. The platform is around halfway through the level, so it probably wouldn't benefit us too much.

### Yoshi's House

Now we get the Overworld movement item. Optimizing entry to the item area is really tough, because we need some correct Y speed to even get in there.

### Bastion in Blue B

I spent a lot of time optimizing this, and I still feel it is improvable, but I threw in the towel after many hours. I still think it looks nice, and the break is surprising if you haven't seen the any% yet.

### Bastion in Blue A

We can't go too crazy in the Boo fight because it's very easy to get lag frames here; I hope it's entertaining, though :-)

## World 2

### Rad Rugby Knoll

Unfortunately there is so much lag near the goal due to several enemies off-screen. Not a lot we can do about this. I hit the ground to reduce over 20 lag frames, but it's still a bit ugly.

### Pipes in Literally Everyone's Business

Two trivial clips are used to remove a lot of navigation.

### TIDES, OK?

Fairly straightforward. It's faster to 6/5 in the first area to have flight immediately at the second, by about 30F.

### Land of the Jolly Tan

A new glitch that is specific to this hack, called "Hypercloud" by the community, is used. This allows us to get 125 speed! At the goal, we use a duplication to clip through the wall to the goal.

### Effortland B

Straightforward.

### Euphoric Mushroom Backyard

TASer's nightmare. Long. Laggy, and lots of obstacles to stop you going fast. I'm really happy with how it turned out, though.

In the first area, we hit a Chuck from the right, which loses some frames but saves dozens of lag frames as it stops the Chuck splitting. When too many sprites are on screen, a Wiggler's body sections don't spawn correctly. This is used to get into the pipe early.

In the underground section, it's possible to get P-Speed by damage boosting, to get out of the gap with 49 speed. It's slower by about 5F. I decided not to do it even if it looks a little better.

In the third area, we get two POWs by double-hitting the block. One POW is used to save some time at the end.

### Random Blue Switch

In the large room, I tested several ideas to get over the wall. The ceiling tiles are solid, so clipping through the slope does not work. Simple spinjump + walljump seemed to be the fastest.

### Effortland A

No comment 

### Beezos in the Trap

I tried to avoid flying under the level as much as possible, but the enemies are placed in awkward spots.

### Roy's Terrible Sadistic Castle

First area: screen is scrolled right to force the Grinder and Podoboo to spawn earlier, which facilitates the corner clip.

Water area: Very laggy, but a nice clip through the floor keeps it entertaining, I think!
